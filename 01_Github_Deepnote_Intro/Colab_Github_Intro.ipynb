You can even **customize shortcuts** to your own liking. Here are some examples of default shortcuts in Colab:\n  * edit cell: enter\n  * run current cell: shift + enter\n  * insert code cell above: Ctrl/⌘ + M + A\n  * insert code cell below: Ctrl/⌘ + M + B\n  * delete cell/selection: Ctrl/⌘ + M + D\n  * interupt execution: Ctrl/⌘ + M + I\n  * convert to code cell: Ctrl/⌘ + M + Y\n  * convert to text cell: Ctrl/⌘ + M + M\n* To run all cells in a notebook use Runtime > Run All.\n* Move the cell you are currently editing up or down in the notebook's cell order by clicking the up/down arrows in the top right corner. \n* Download your current notebook to your local drive using File > Download .ipynb \n* To clear a code cell's output click on the 3 dots in the top right corner and select \"clear output\".",

Instead of selecting the file upload icon you should select the right most one labeled \"Mount Drive\" when you hover over it.\n2. In your first time mounting your drive for a notebook, clicking the icon should make a Code Cell appear.
